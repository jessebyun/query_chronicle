<h1>Analyze a Phishing Incident</h1>

Scenario - Received an alert that an employee received a phishing email in their inbox. Upon review, identified a suspicious domain name contained in the email's body:  "signin.office365x24.com". To investigate further I will utilize Chronicle to determine whether any other employees have received phishing emails containing this domain and whether they have visited the domain.
